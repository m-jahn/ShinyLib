### Getting started

Simply open the app at https://m-jahn.shinyapps.io/ShinyLib/!

If you want to *run ShinyLib locally*, you need to have R (optionally also Rstudio) and some of its libraries installed:

- `shiny`
- `shinythemes`
- `shinyTree`
- `lattice`
- `latticeExtra`
- `latticetools` [on github](https://github.com/m-jahn/lattice-tools)
- `directlabels`
- `tidyr`
- `dplyr`
- `dendextend`
- `configr`

Open `global.R`, `server.R` or `ui.R` in RStudio and push the `Run App` button in Rstudio, done!
You can also run the app from R console, just call `runApp("path-to-ShinyLib")`.

### Input data

- `ShinyLib` uses fold change and fitness data derived from next generation sequencing
- can be easily customized for use with other library-type data
- can be deployed on a shiny server for web-access
- current data sets:

| name | year | organism | screening  | size | conditions |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ---- | --------- | ---------- |
| `Cupriavidus_BarSeq_2023` | 2023 | *Cupriavidus* | BarSeq transposon | 60,000 | lithoautotrophy and nitrate respiration |
| `Cupriavidus_BarSeq_2021` | 2021 | *Cupriavidus* | BarSeq transposon | 60,000 | various carbon sources |
| `CRISPRi_library_2022` | 2022 | *Synechocystis* | CRISPRi | 22,000 | 11 light and CO2 limitations |
| `CRISPRi_library_2019` | 2019 | *Synechocystis* | CRISPRi | 10,000 | low light, high light, day-night |


### Browsing transposon or CRISPRi mutant libraries

**ShinyLib** is an R Shiny based app for exploration of gene-centered data from enrichment or depletion studies. Such a library with thousands of mutants can be grown in competition experiments, leading to the depletion of growth-inhibited mutants and enrichment of faster growing mutants. By extracting the DNA and sequencing the barcode/sgRNA of the mutant population, we can investigate which genes are _essential_ or contribute to _fitness_ for the selected conditions.

Features:

- Displays dot plots of fold depletion/enrichment over time
- Heatmaps and clustering of proteins/genes by fitness similarity
- Fitness scores can be plotted as variable of one or two conditions
- The original data table can be filtered by pathways or single genes, and selected data can be downloaded
- Different variables can be plotted on X and Y axis, or used as conditioning variable (panel-view)
- All charts are interactive R Shiny modules and can be adjusted by many parameters

### Structure

ShinyLib consists of a set of R scripts that determine the functionality.

- `global.R` loads the `*.Rdata` data sets and the accompanying `*.yml` configuration files.
- `server.R` contains the main body of functions. The server obtains input parameters from the GUI and adjusts the graphical output accordingly (changes charts on the fly)
- `ui.R` The GUI contains the interactive modules such as sliders and check boxes.
- `dotplot.R`, `heatmap.R`,`fitness.R` Plotting functions for each tab
- `custom_themes.R` contains a set of customized lattice themes
- `custom_panel_functions.R` contains a set of custom lattice panel functions
- `helpbox.R` contains info boxes for help, contact, and background information
